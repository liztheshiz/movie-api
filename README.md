# Cinema.Database API

This API provides an interactive database of information on films, directors, and genres. Additionally, users can register to create and manage a list of their favorite films.

This API was built primarily for use with the [Cinema.Database]() React app, and is also used by the [MyFlix]() Angular version app.

## Dev instructions

This API uses primarily Express to handle requests to the server. JWT authentication required for most requests.

A complete collection of endpoints for testing in [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) has been included in the GitHub repo!

## Deploy instructions

This API is deployed to [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login). To deploy, navigate to the directory in the CLI and type command:

`git push heroku main`

Heroku Free - which this API uses - will no longer be available past Nov 28, 2022. Free options will remain for students (this API was a student project), details pending.
